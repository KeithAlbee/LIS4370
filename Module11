# R Markdown

## Headers 
Headers can be added by using hashtags in your markdown file. One hashtag indicates a larger header, while two or three will be smaller as the number of hashtags increases. 

*Note: You can only have up to three hashtags as there are only three types of headers* 

## Chunks of Code
You can add spaces for programming by using ``` followed by {r} and another pair of three so RStudio will know what to run while knitting to HTML. Here is an example: 

```{r}
myData <- mtcars
head(myData)
```
As you can see, the result of the data will be shown below the chunk in the HTML file. 

## Lists and Font
Lists can be created in two ways: numbers or bullets. A numbered list can be created by typing a number followed by a period. To create subpoints below that, press enter and tab, then type a + sign before your text. The outcome will look like this: 

1. Grocery List
  + Milk
  + Eggs
  + Bread
2. To-Do List
  + Call doctor
  + Schedule appointment 
  + Pick-up prescription
  
  In order to *italicize* font, surround the chosen text with an asterisk on each side. Similarly, to make it **bold**, wrap it with two on each side.

## Page Breaks 
A page break can be added in one of two ways: a series of **three or more** asterisks or hyphens.
